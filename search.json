    "text": "“Heterogeneous Firms and Optimal Emission Tax” October 2022 -\nA large number of environmental regulations take the form of industry standards imposed by the regulators, usually based on the least polluting technology already observed in the industry. Najjar and Cherniwchan find that industry standards in Canada have mostly affected the level of pollutant emissions through exits of plants and reallocations of the market shares of the surviving plants rather than through reduction of plants’ emissions. More broadly, to the extent that more productive firms tend to pollute less per unit of output, any policy targeting emission rates might concentrate the activity and increase the market-power of large firms. To the best of my knowledge, this trade-off has not yet been at the forefront of the economic analysis. I propose to examine the effect of a given regulation on the markups of polluting markets and quantify the distortive effect of some environmental policies.\n\n\n\n“Global sourcing and linguistic proximity” A 2021\nRecent research has emphasized the role of cultural values and norms in the make or buy dilemma. In this light, I investigated the link between language proximity and the scope of firms. I developed a simple analytical model where firms sourcing in a foreign country may choose between outsourcing and integration. Integration achieves a higher degree of coordination (which acts as a preference shifter in the utility of consumers, creating an incentive to coordinate) but generates higher fixed costs. I assumed that within an industry, this difference in fixed cost is decreasing in linguistic proximity. It follows that in countries which are close linguistically, more firms integrate their supplier. Using data on intrafirm trade from the U.S. Bureau of Census and a measure of linguistic distance based on the cladastic distances of languages spoken in a pair of countries from the U.S. International Trade Commission, I found that language proximity positively affects the probability of observing intrafirm trade but not the share of intrafirm in total trade.\n\n\n\n\nDataset from Refinitiv Eikon 2022\nGenetic distance and religions dataset 2021\nDemand in foreign language skills dataset from O*NET 2021\nOECD ADIMA dataset 2018 vintage 2019"
